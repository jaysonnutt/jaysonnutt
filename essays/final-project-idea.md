# Project Name
RateMyClass

## Overview

### Problem
UH Manoa has hundreds of classes by various professors. There are good classes where you learn a lot and there are not-so-good classes that you just take for the credit. As of now, there is no good way to determine which classes are the best. Currently, the only way to learn if a class is good or bad is by asking your friends who have already taken the class.

### Solution
RateMyClass is a crowdsourced solution for students to determine which are the optimal classes to take with the help of other student experience. 

## Mockup Page Ideas

It will have a homepage that 

RateMyClass has two user roles, all of whom login with their UH ID. Regular users will create a profile indicating which classes they need to take and which classes they have already taken.
