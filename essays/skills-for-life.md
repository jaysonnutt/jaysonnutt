## My Background

I am taking software engineering as a Senior in the Information & Computer Science (ICS) program. I have taken almost all of the other ICS courses that are needed for graduation. Although I have some experience with programming, I think that software engineering will be one of the courses that I benefit the most from. Javascript is one of, if not the most, used languages today. It consistantly tops GitHub's list of most popular programming languages. It is somewhat surprising to me that my first experience with it will be as a senior. The rest of the ICS program focuses on languages like Java and C/C++. These languages certainly have their use cases, but Javascript is the language of the web. With the dominant role that the web plays in today's society, knowing Javascript will be a great benefit in the future.

## Javascript is Just the Beginning

While Javascript is the language used in the software engineering course, it is somewhat arbitrary in a sense. The primary benefit from the course will come from learning the skills that are not unique to any programming language in particular. These skills are not necessarily "hands on keyboard" but rather skills that will help us with any development project. Skills like group communication, project planning, collaboration tools, and user interface design are all crucial skills to know when entering the work force. Some of these skills extend beyond software engineering and have an impact on the rest of our lives.

## What I Hope to Learn

I don't recall any of the software development projects that I have worked on so far in the ICS program exceededing 1,000 lines of code. I hope to learn how to effectively participate in medium/large scale projects. Projects of this size come with their own unique challenges and I hope to learn how to overcome those challenges. The ICS program focused mainly on the functionality of the program and did not emphasize design. I hope to learn all that I can about user interfaces and design. After all, it doesn't matter that your program works if no one is able to use it.
