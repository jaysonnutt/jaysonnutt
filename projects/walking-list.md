summary: An interactive list used by political candidates when campaigning door to door.
---

This project was developed for my ICS 415 class. We were each assigned a street in Hawaii and provided with actual voter data from that street. The purpose of this web application is to assist political candidates as they walk door-to-door campaigning. It provides them with information about the voter before encountering them. The application supports search and other features to refine the list. The candidate has the capability to rate the encounter on a scale from -2 to 2 and add a comment to the house to give them a better idea of how receptive the person was for future use. The candidate can refine the list and click a button to download the results as a CSV file which can then be used in other applications such as Microsoft Excel. The tables are dynamically populated drawing from a MySQL database. The lists are divided by house number into even and odd lists so that the candidate can walk up one side of the street and back down.
